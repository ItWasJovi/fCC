# Applied Accessibility

"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.

## Text Alternatives for Images

- Good `alt` text is short but descriptive, and meant to briefly convey the meaning of the image.
- **Empty** `alt` text is fine when the image is purely decorative/does not add meaning. It can just be an **empty string** `alt=""`
- Captioned images should still have `alt` text for SEO

## Heading Usage

- Typically one page should only have **one `h1`** and everything else ordered hierarchically.

## New HTML5 Element Tags

- Tags like `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `article`, and `section`, among others gives additional semantic meaning to our site.
- As such, content should be wrapped in the appropriate tags.
- `main` covers the main content of what the page is about.
- `article` is for independent, self-contained content.
- `section` is for grouping thematically related content.
- `div` is for grouping content in general.
- `header` is used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag, and works well for content repeated on the top of multiple pages.
- `nav` is to wrap navigation links.
- `footer` is for bottom-area content such as copyright information and/or related links.

## Audio Content

`audio` gives semantic meaning when it wraps any sort of audio content in the page.

- Audio content usually includes text alternatives (transcript, captions, or other relevant text).

```
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
```

## Charts & Figures

`figure` along with `figcaption` can be used to give semantic meaning and accessibility to visual representations (ie. images, diagrams, charts, etc.)

- For **data** visualisations, captions should note the trends and conclusions.

## Labels

`label` wraps the text for a specific form control item. The `for` attribute on a `label` tag explicitly associates that `label` with the form control.

```
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>
```

The value of the `for` attribute must be the same as the value of the `id` attribute of the form control.

## Fieldset

`fieldset` surrounds a group of inputs - usually radio buttons and uses a `legend` tag to provide description for the grouping.

```
<fieldset>
	<legend>Description</legend>
</fieldset>
```

## Dates

HTML5 introduced the `time` tag with `datetime` as an attribute to standardise times. These are inline elements that can wrap a date or time on a page.

- `datetime` holds a valid format of the date to be read by assistive devices.

## Screen Reader-only elements using custom CSS

CSS can be used to hide elements that are just for screen readers. They can simply be **moved off the visual area of the browser**.

```
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  top: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

- `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;` hides the content completely.
- Setting zero value pixels sizes also removes elements from the page.

## Misc. Accessibility

- Anchor `a` tags should wrap around descriptive text for accessibility (instead of 'Click Here').
- `accesskey` attribute specifies a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element - think keybinds.

### Keyboard Focus with `tabindex`

- Most elements automatically have keyboard focus **in the order they come in the HTML source code**.
- Using `tabindex="0"` gives other elements keyboard focus.
- A negative `tabindex` value (usually -*1*) indicates that an element is focusable, but not via the keyboard.
- `tabindex` allows CSS pseudo-class `::focus` to work.
- Setting `tabindex` to integers (1, 2, 3, etc.) will cycle through in order until the end and go back to `tabindex="0"` items.
