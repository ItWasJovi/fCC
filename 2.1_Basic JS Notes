# Basic JS

## Objects

Declaration of object is like variables, but with brackets;
```
var myObj = {
  "prop 1" = "value 1";
  prop2 = 2;
}
```

Access to object properties can be done via `.` notation and also `[]` bracket notation. New properties can be added the same way.

- Bracket notation can be used to access the *value* of object variables by matching them to another variable.

### Deleting Properties

As simple as `delete myObj.myProp`

### Checking Properties

You can check if an Object has a particular named property using:

`myObj.hasOwnProperty(prop);`
