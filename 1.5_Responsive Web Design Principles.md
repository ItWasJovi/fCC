# Responsive Web Design Principles

Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. 

Viewport
: A user's visible area of a web page. Varies depending on the device used to access the site.

- Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied. 

Example of a media query that returns the content when the device's width is less than or equal to 100px:

`@media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }`

and the following media query returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px:

`@media (min-height: 350px) { /* CSS Rules */ }`

CSS inside the media query is applied **only if the media type matches that of the device** being used.

## Making Images Responsive

Making image responsive is quite simple:

```
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
  height: auto;
}
```

- `max-width` will make the image fill the container, but never beyond it's own width.
- `display: block` overrides the default inline display method, putting it on a new line.
- `height: auto` ensures aspect ratio is maintained.

## Hi-rez Retina Images

The simplest way to make images appear HD is to define `width` and `height` as **50%** of it's original size

## Responsive Typography

Instead of `em` or `px` text sizes, we can use **viewport units** for responsive typography. 

- Viewport units are **relative** to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device.

The four different viewport units are:

- `vw: 10vw` would be 10% of the viewport's width.
- `vh: 3vh` would be 3% of the viewport's height.
- `vmin: 70vmin` would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).
- `vmax: 100vmax` would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width).
