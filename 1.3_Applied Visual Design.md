# Applied Visual Design

## Pseudo Classes

Used to alter styles based on certain states. For example:

`a:hover` will only change links when they are hovered on.

## Relative Positioning

- Since CSS uses a Block Model, positioning an object using `relative` will move it somewhere *relative to where it's supposed to be*.
- Thus, offseting when positon is set to `relative` will effectively move the element in the **opposite direction**.

## Absolute Positioning

- `absolute` locks the element in place relative to its parent container.
- Usually nested inside a container with a `relative` position.

## Fixed Positioning

- `fixed` is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element *relative to the browser window*.
- Similar to `absolute` positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also *removes the element from the normal flow of the document*.

## Float

- Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. 
- It's commonly used with the `width` property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.
- Visually, it's like bubbles floating to the surface.

## Z-Index

- The `z-index` property specifies **how elements are stacked**.
- **Higher** values = higher in the stack.

## CSS Color

- `hsl()` works like it does anywhere else and can be used to quickly modify a color.
- Gradients: `background: linear-gradient(90deg, color 1, color 2, ...,);`
- Repeating gradients:
```
background: repeating-linear-gradient(
      45deg,
      yellow 0px,
      yellow 40px,
      black 40px,
      black 80px
```
`px` values define where the new color starts.

## Transform

CSS has various `transform:` functions

- `transform: scale(factor)` will scale an element based on the scale factor number.
- `transform: skewX(#deg)` will skew horizontally by a given degree.
- `transform: skewY(#deg)` will skew vertically by a given degree.

## Pseudo-elements

- `::before` and `::after` are used to add something before or after a selected element.
- To function, they must have a defined `content` property - usually an image or text.

## CSS Keyframes & Animation Properties

- `@keyframes` control what happen during an animation.
- `animation-name` sets the name of the animation, later used by `@keyframes` to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.
- `animation-duration` sets the length of time for the animation.

```
#anim {
  animation-name: colorful;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
@keyframes colorful {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
```
- `animation-fill-mode` determines what state the element ends at. `forwards` will take the end state.
- `animation-iteration-count` specifies how many times the animation runs.
- `animation-timing-function` controls how quickly an element changes over time (think easing in AE)

### Bezier Curves

Keywords aside, CSS offers finer control through **Bezier Curves** via `cubic-bezier`.

`animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2);`

- `cubic-bezier` consists of four main points that sit on a x-y grid.
- Start and End points are always *(0,0)* and *(1,1)* respectively.
- We only set the middle two points, which determine the shape of the curve.
