# CSS

CSS works by telling certain elements on a page how they should look. This is done through the use of **selectors** that change the **properties** of an element.

## Application

CSS can be applied thru various means:

1. Inline on the individual element tag itself via `style=""`
2. At the top of the page
``` <style>

	</style>
```
3. In an external .css file

## Classes

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. All classes start with a `.` period - `.class`.

- Classes are then used by adding the `class=""` attribute.
- Multiple classes can be added simply by adding a space in between each.

## IDs

In addition to classes, HTML elements can be given `id` attributes. These can be used by CSS for styling and JS for modification. `id` styles start with a hash `#`. They also have higher *specificity*.

- `id` attributes should be unique

## Attribute Selectors
> New

It's possible to use `[attr=value]` as a selector. This selector matches and **styles elements with a specific attribute value**.

```
[type='radio']
{
	margin: 20px 0px 0px 20px;
}
```

## !important CSS Override

As we often use CSS libraries, if we need to be sure that an element has a specific CSS, we can use `!important`

## CSS Variables

A way to change many CSS style properties at once.

**Declaration**
`--variable: value;`

**Value Assignment**
`attribute: var(--variable, fallback)`
Fallback variables are useful for compatibility and troubleshooting.

### Cascading Variables
Variable are available inside the elements they are created in and any elements nested within. Hence, **CSS variables are often defined in `:root`**.

Declaring variables in `:root` makes them available throughout the whole web page.

Variables can be overwritten by **setting them again in the specific element**.

### Media Queries
We can change the value of a variable if the screen area is smaller/larger than a media query break point

`@media (max-width: 350px)`

## Padding vs. Margin

- Padding: Space between **element** and **border**
- Margin: Space between **border** and surrounding **elements**


# CSS Font Degradation 
> New

Font degradation allows you to tell the browser to "degrade" to another font if the primary one isn't available. It is done simply by listing the alternative font after the main one:

```
p {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```
