# CSS

CSS works by telling certain elements on a page how they should look. This is done through the use of **selectors** that change the **properties** of an element.

## Application

CSS can be applied thru various means:

1. Inline on the individual element tag itself via `style=""`
2. At the top of the page
``` <style>

	</style>
```
3. In an external .css file

## Classes

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. All classes start with a `.` period - `.class`.

- Classes are then used by adding the `class=""` attribute.

## CSS Font Degradation

Font degradation allows you to tell the browser to "degrade" to another font if the primary one isn't available. It is done simply by listing the alternative font after the main one:

```
p {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```
