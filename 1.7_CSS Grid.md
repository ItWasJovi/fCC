# CSS Grid

We can turn any HTML element into a grid container using `display: grid`.

- In CSS Grid, the parent is the *container* and the children are *items*.
- Grids need to be defined using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`.

```
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
}
```

The above gives the grid two columns that are 50px wide each and two rows that are 50px tall.

## Sizing

Absolute and relative units work to define the size of rows & columns. Additionally:

- `fr`: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space.
- `auto`: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically.
- `%`: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.

`grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr`

With the above, the first column is as wide as its content, the second is 50px, the third is 10% of the container, and the last two columns are the remaining space divided into three sections - 2 for the fourth column and 1 for the fifth.

## Gaps

- For column gaps: `grid-column-gap: 10px`
- For row gaps: `grid-row-gap: 10px`
- For a combo: `grid-gap` - if one value it's both, if two values, it's row then column.

## Controling Space

`grid-column` is for the grid items themselves. The hypothetical horizontal and vertical lines that create the grid are referred to as *lines*. These lines are numbered starting with 1 at the top left corner of the grid and move right for columns and down for rows, counting upward.

```
grid-column: 1 / 3
```

The above will make an item start from the 1st vertical line of the grid on the left and span to the 3rd line of the grid, consuming two columns.

A similar concept applies with `grid-row`

```
grid-row: 1 / 3
```

## Alignment

### Horizontal

In CSS Grid, the content of each item is located in a box which is referred to as a *cell*. Content can be aligned within its cell horizontally using `justify-self` which by default a a value of `stretch`, filling the whole width of the cell.

- `start`: aligns to the left of the cell.
- `center`: aligns to the center of the cell.
- `end`: aligns to the right of the cell.

To justify all items, `justify-items` should be used.

### Vertical

Aligning an item vertically is the same as above, except using `align-self`. It accepts the same properties.

To align all items, `align-items` should be used.

## Areas

We can group cells of the grid together into an *area* and give them a custom name using `grid-template-areas`

```
grid-template-areas:
  "header header header"
  "advert content content"
  "footer footer footer";
```

This merges the top three into an area named *header*, the bottom three into *footer* and makes two areas in the middle named *advert* and *content*.

Every word is a cell, and every pair of quotation marks `""` is a row. Periods `.` can be used to designate an empty cell in the grid.

### Placing Items in Grid Areas using `grid-area`

After defining the area templates, we can place items in the containers using the given names:

`.item1 { grid-area: header; }`
OR
`item1 { grid-area: 1/1/2/4; }`

The latter method uses the *line* numbers again in the following format:
> `grid-area: horizontal line to start at / vertical line to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end at;`

## Reduce Repetition

We can define grid structures using the `repeat function` to specify the number of rows/columns to be repeated.

`grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px);`

This would create 100 rows, each row 50px tall. The function accepts repetitions, then row/column size as arguments.
