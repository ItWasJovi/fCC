# CSS Flexbox

CSS3 introduced Flexible Boxes, or flexbox, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers.

## `display: flex`

- Turns an element into a **flex container**, making it possible to align any child of that element into **rows** or **columns**. 
- This is done by adding `flex-direction` to the parent item and setting it to row or column. It is **row by default**.
- `flex-direction` takes `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` to reverse the direction of items.

## Aligning Elements in flexbox

`justify-content` is used to align flex items as sometimes items do not fill all the space within a container.

![Flex Concept](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg)

Thd direction flex items are arranged is called the **main axis**.

- For *rows*, this is a **horizontal line** that cuts through each item.
- For *columns*, the main axis is a **vertical line** through items.

Other options that aligns items include:


- `flex-start`: align items to the start of the container (ie. *left-top*)
- `flex-end`: aligns items to the end of the container (ie. *right-bottom*)
- `space-between`: align items to the center & sides with equal space in between items.
- `space-around`: As aobe, but first and last items are not locked to the sides. Space is distributed around all items.

`align-items` aligns items along the **cross axis** - vertical for rows, horizontal for columns.

- `flex-start`: align items to the start of the container (ie. *top-left*)
- `flex-end`: aligns items to the end of the container (ie. *bottom-right*)
- `center`: align items to the center (ie. *vertical/horizontal*)
- `stretch`: stretches items to fill the flex container.
- `baseline`: align items to baseline (ie. text baseline that letters sit on)

## Wrapping

By default, a flex container fits all items together. `flex-wrap` causes extra items to move into a new row or column. The break point of where the wrapping happens **depends on the size of the items and the size of the container**.

- `nowrap`: default setting
- `wrap`: wraps items from left-to-right, or top-to-bottom.
- `wrap reverse`: wraps items from bottom-to-top, or right-to-left.

## Shrinking

`flex-shrink` allows us to shrink flex items if the flex container is too small.

- Takes numbers as values. Higher number = more shrink.

## Expanding

`flex-grow` controls the size of items when the parent container expands.

- Takes numbers as values. Higher number = more expansion.

## Initial (Base) Sizing

`flex-basis` specifies the initial size of an item before CSS makes adjustments with `flex-shrink` or `flex-grow`.

- Same as other size photos, meaning you can use `px`, `em`, `%`, etc.
- `auto` will size items based on content.

## Flex Shorthand

To set all the above three properties at once, we can use `flex: grow, shrink, basis`.

`flex: 0 1 auto` is the default

## Order

`order` tells CSS the order of how flex items appear in the flex container. By default, it will be the same as the source HTML.

- Takes numbers as values, including negatives.

## Self Alignment

`align-self` allows adjustment of each item individually. Accepts the same values as `align-items` and will override.
