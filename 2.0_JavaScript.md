# Basic JS

## Objects

Declaration of object is like variables, but with brackets;
```
var myObj = {
  "prop 1" = "value 1";
  prop2 = 2;
}
```

Access to object properties can be done via `.` notation and also `[]` bracket notation. New properties can be added the same way.

- Bracket notation can be used to access the *value* of object variables by matching them to another variable.

### Deleting Properties

As simple as `delete myObj.myProp`

### Checking Properties

You can check if an Object has a particular named property using:

`myObj.hasOwnProperty(prop);`

# ES6

ECMAScript is a standardized version of JavaScript with the goal of unifying the language's specifications and features. As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term ECMAScript is interchangeable with the term JavaScript.

## Declaring Variables

- `let` does the same thing as `var` except when using `let`, a variable with the same name **can only be declared once**.

- `let` variables are limited to a block, statement, or expression if declared in such ways. *E.g. If `let` is used in a for loop, it only exists within the loop whereas `var` would be global`*.

- `"use strict";` enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions.

- `const` is like `let` but they are **read-only**. Some devs will assign all variables as `const` unless they know they need to change it.

- `const` **OBJECTS** (e.g. arrays, functions) are still mutable.

```
"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]
```
## Freezing Objects

Since `const` does not complete protect data from mutation, JS has `Object.freeze` to prevent data mutation - `Object.freeze(myObj);`

- Frozen objects will throw errors in attempts to add, update, or delete properties from it.

## Arrow Functions

Typically used when **a function is not reused anywhere else and thus does not need to be named**. An example case is when passing a function as an argument to another function.

```
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```

If the function has no body, keywords and brackets can be omitted as follows:

`const myFunc = () => "value"`

This will always return `value`.

### Arrow Functions with Parameters

Arguments are simply passed in the brackets. Possible with more than one argument.

```
// doubles input value and returns it
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
```

### Higher Order Arrow Functions

Arrow functions can be very powerful for data processing. They work well with higher order functions such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` that *take other functions as arguments* for processing collections of data.

## Default Function Parameters

If no arguments are specified/undefined, JS will default to the specified *default* parameter:

```
function greeting(name = "Anonymous") {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
console.log(greeting("John")); // Hello John
console.log(greeting()); // Hello Anonymous
```
## Rest Operator

Allows creation of functions that take a **variable number of arguments**. These arguments are stored as an *array* that can be access from inside the function.

```
function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2)); // You have passed 3 arguments
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { })); // You have passed 4 arguments.
```

## Spread Operator

Allows expansion of arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

```
const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr); // returns 89
```
## Destructuring Assignments

A special syntax for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object to variables.
```
var voxel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54 };
var x = voxel.x; // x = 3.6
var y = voxel.y; // y = 7.4
var z = voxel.z; // z = 6.54
```
Assignment of variables can instead be done as simply as:
`const { x : a, y : b, z : c } = voxel // a = 3.6, b = 7.4, c = 6.54`

Also possible with nested objects. For example, to obtain `max` of `forecast.tomorrow` and assign it to `maxOfTomorrow`:
```
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  today: { min: 72, max: 83 },
  tomorrow: { min: 73.3, max: 84.6 }
};

function getMaxOfTmrw(forecast) {
  "use strict";
  const { tomorrow : { max : maxOfTomorrow } } = forecast;
  return maxOfTomorrow;
}
```

### Destructuring Arrays
```
const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
```
Variable `a` is assigned to the first value, `b` to the second and so on. To navigate further indexes, we just add `,,,` commas until the desired index.

We can also split arrays into a separate collection/array as follows:
```
const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
console.log(arr); // [3, 4, 5, 7]
```

### Destructuring for Functions
The following code destructures an object:
```
const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  // do something with these variables
}
```
However this can be rewritten in the following way:
```
const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  /* do something with these fields */
}
```

## Creating Strings using Template Literals
Template literals allow the creation of multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.
```
const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

// Template literal with multi-line and string interpolation
const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting); // prints
// Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!
// I am 56 years old.
```
- The string is wrapped in `` ` `` backticks
- The string is multi-line with using `\n`
- The `${variable}` syntax is used instead of concatenation with `+`. Note that it is possible to use something like `${a + b}`

## Concise Object Literal Declarations using Simple Fields
Instead of writing redundancies like `x : x` in the following code:
```
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
  x: x,
  y: y
});
```
We can use new ES6 syntax to write it much more simply:
`const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });`

## Concise Declarative Functions
In ES6, the word `function` is no longer needed to define a function **in objects**. All that is needed is `functionName(args)`.

## Using class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function
The syntax is simply:
```
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet){
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

## Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object
- Getter functions simply return the value of an object's variable
- Setter functions modify the value of an object's variable based on the value passed into it.
```
class Book {
  constructor(author) {
    this._author = author;
  }
  // getter
  get writer(){
    return this._author;
  }
  // setter
  set writer(updatedAuthor){
    this._author = updatedAuthor;
  }
}
const lol = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(lol.writer);  // anonymous
lol.writer = 'wut';
console.log(lol.writer);  // wut
```

## import vs require
`import` lets us choose which files to load into a given file, instead of `require()` which will load things in entirety. A common use case would be something like:
```
import { function } from "file_path_goes_here"
// We can also import variables the same way!
```
To import everything, simply use a wildcard `*` instead of the brackets:
```
import * as myMathModule from "math_functions";
myMathModule.add(2,3);
myMathModule.subtract(5,3);
```

## export to Reuse Code
We can import things but in order to do so they need to be exported first. The syntax is the same as `import`:
```
const capitalizeString = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
export { capitalizeString } //How to export functions.
export const foo = "bar"; //How to export variables.
```
## Export Fallback with export default
Usually used if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module:
```
export default function add(x,y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

## Importing export defaults
The syntax is not much different than regular `import` syntax, we just leave out the brackets:
`import function from "location"`

# Regular Expressions - regex / regexp
Also known as "regex" or "regexp", they help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning. The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want, but only what you want.

## the Test Method
One way to test a regex is using the `.test()` method, which applies the method to a strong and returns `true` or `false` depending on the string.
```
let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
let testRegex = /Code/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true
```

## regex with Different Possibilities
It's possible to search for multiple patterns using the `OR` operator `|`. This operator is not limited to two `/yes|no|maybe/`

## Ignoring Case
Previous regex expressions take into account case, but **flags** can be used to ignore case. In this case, it is the `i` flag which is added at the end `/findMatch/i`

## Extract Matches
Using the `.match()` method allows us to extract the actual found match.
```
"Hello, World!".match(/Hello/);
// Returns ["Hello"]
let ourStr = "Regular expressions";
let ourRegex = /expressions/;
ourStr.match(ourRegex);
// Returns ["expressions"]
```

## Find More than the First Match
Finding or Extracting a search pattern is done using the `g` flag:
```
let repeatRegex = /Repeat/g;
testStr.match(repeatRegex);
// Returns ["Repeat", "Repeat", "Repeat"]
```
Flags can be compounded too - `/search/gi`

## Wildcards
With regex, the wildcard character is a period `.`. You can simply write `/.un/` to find words like "bun", "fun", and "sun".

## Match a Single Character from a Particular Set
We can define *character classes* by putting them inside square `[set]` brackets. Hence, `/b[aiu]g/` would attempt to match "a", "i", and "u" in the given string.

## Defining a Range of Characters
Using character sets becomes a problem when there's a lot of characters to match, but using a hyphen `-` we can define a range of characters. This works for both numbers and letters:
```
[a-z]
[3-7]
[a-z0-9]
```

## Exclusions
We can create a set of characters that we *don't* want to match. These are called **negated character sets**. Creating one uses a *caret* `^` character after the opening bracket and before the characters we don't want to match - `/[^aeiou]/gi`

## Match Characters that Occur One or More Times
Using the `+` character lets us match repeated matches.
```
let difficultSpelling = "Mississippi";
let myRegex = /ss+/g;
let result = difficultSpelling.match(myRegex);
// returns an array with two matches of "ss"
```

## Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times
Similar to the `+`, the asterisk `*` matches characters that occur zero or more times:
```
let soccerWord = "gooooooooal!";
let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
let oPhrase = "over the moon";
let goRegex = /go*/;
soccerWord.match(goRegex); // Returns ["goooooooo"]
gPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns ["g"]
oPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns null
```

## Find Characters with Lazy Matching
By default, regexes find **greedy** matches which finds the longest possible part of a string that fits the regex pattern. **Lazy** matches are the opposite and find the smallest possible part of the string that satisfies the pattern. This is done with a `?`
```
let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
let myRegex = /<h1>?/; // Change this line
let result = text.match(myRegex);
```

## Match Beginning String Patterns
Outside of a *character set*, the caret `^` is used to search for patterns at the **beginning** of strings.
```
let firstString = "Ricky is first and can be found.";
let firstRegex = /^Ricky/;
firstRegex.test(firstString);
// Returns true
let notFirst = "You can't find Ricky now.";
firstRegex.test(notFirst);
// Returns false
```

## Match Ending String Patterns
Similar to the caret, instead we're looking at the **end** of a string and using the dollar sign `$` character. However, they are placed at the *end* of the regex:
```
let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
// Returns true
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
storyRegex.test(noEnding);
// Returns false
```

## Match All Letters and Numbers
JS has a built-in character class - `\w` to present the alphabet which is equal to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. Hence the regex would be `/\w/`

## Match Everything But Letters and Numbers
The opposite of the `\w` character set is with a capital W - `\W` which is equivalent to `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`

## Match All Numbers
There exists shortcuts for numbers - `\d` which is equivalent to `[0-9]`

## Match All Non-Numbers
Similar to the inverse of letters, matching non-numbers just requires a capital D - `\D` which is basically `[^0-9]`

## Restrict Possible Usernames
Usernames are extremely common online. Some rules governing usernames typically are:

1. Numbers can only be at the end (zero or more of them)
2. Usernames are case sensitive, but can be lowercase and uppercase
3. Usernames have to be at least two characters long, and if so can only be two alphabet characters

A regex to test these conditions are as follows:
```
let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
let userCheck = /^[a-z]{2,}\d*$/i;
let result = userCheck.test(username);
```
Note: The `{2,}` is known as a **quantifier**. In this case it means match 2 times (for a username of minimum two letters)

## Match Whitespace
The character class for matching whitespace is `\s` and it includes - *carriage return*, *tab*, *form feed*, and *new line* characters. It is equivalent to `[\r\t\f\n\v]`

## Match Non-Whitespace Characters
To search for everything *but* whitespace, it is the inverse - `/S` which is equal to `[^ \r\t\f\n\v]`. This returns everything but whitespace:
```
let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
let nonSpaceRegex = /\S/g;
whiteSpace.match(nonSpaceRegex).length; // Returns 32
```

## Quantifiers - Specifying Upper and Lower No. of Matches
Quantifiers are used with curly brackets - `{` and `}` - to match a lower and upper number of patterns:
```
let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4); // Returns true
multipleA.test(A2); // Returns false
```
- Specifying only one number *and a comma* will only specify the lower or upper limit respectively.
- Specifying a number *without a comma* gives an **exact** number of matches.

## Check for All or None
To check the possible existence of an element, we can use the question mark `?`. Another way to think about it is basically saying the previous element is optional.

## Lookaheads
**Lookaheads** are patterns that tell JS to look-ahead in a string to check for patterns further along. Useful for looking for multiple patterns over the same string.

- **Positive** lookaheads will look to ensure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it. The syntax is `(?=...)` where `...` is the required part.
- **Negative** lookaheads will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is NOT there. The syntax is `(?!...)` where `...` is the pattern you don't want.

An example to check that a password is between 3 to 6 characters and has at least one number:
```
let password = "abc123";
let checkPass = /(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/;
checkPass.test(password); // Returns true
```

## Reuse Patterns using Capture Groups
Capture groups allow us to match patterns multiple times in a string. They are captured in parentheses - `(` and `)` - where the pattern that will repeat is placed inside.

To specify where the repeat string will appear, a backslash `\` then a number is used. It starts at 1 and increases with each additional capture group. An example would be `\1` to match the first group.

This example matches any word that occurs twice separated by a space:
```
let repeatStr = "regex regex";
let repeatRegex = /(\w+)\s\1/;
repeatRegex.test(repeatStr); // Returns true
repeatStr.match(repeatRegex); // Returns ["regex regex", "regex"]
```

## Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace
The method `.replace()` can be used to replace text in a string. The first parameter is the regex pattern to search for, and the second is to replace the match or run a function.
```
let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
// Returns "The sky is blue."
```
It's possible to access capture groups in a replacement string with the dollar sign `$`
```
"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
// Returns "Camp Code"
```

## Remove Whitespace from Start and End
Typically we process strings without any spaces at the start or end
```
let hello = "   Hello, World!  ";
let wsRegex = /^\s+|\s+$/g;
let result = hello.replace(wsRegex, "");
```
